> “Programming is the only job I can think of where I get to be both an engineer and an artist. There's an incredible, rigorous, technical element to it, which I like because you have to do very precise thinking. On the other hand, it has a wildly creative side where the boundaries of imagination are the only real limitation.” – ***Andy Hertzfeld***

## In detail

I am a certified IT Business Manager (IHK) and a certified TYPO3 Integrator, Developer, and Consultant (TCCI, TCCD, TCCC) with many years of experience delivering TYPO3-based web platforms—from conception and design to implementation, operations, and project management (PHP, MySQL, Solr, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypoScript).

I drive the practical adoption of AI in software engineering and web delivery by evaluating tools, IDEs, and workflows, enabling teams in day-to-day usage, and continuously improving internal standards and processes for professional, compliant AI application. In parallel, I design and build an enterprise-ready, GDPR-compliant AI agent stack (multi-agent, RAG, MCP) based on open-source technologies, hosted in EU-based data centers, and optimized for rapid POCs and fast domain onboarding.

I also conceive and implement Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) measures for web systems, integrating AI capabilities directly into website and e-commerce architectures.

My additional strengths include performance engineering (Core Web Vitals), UX/UI design, SEO, analytics/marketing/consent integrations (GTM, GA, Matomo, Ads, HubSpot, Usercentrics, Klaro), and CI/CD automation (GitLab, GitHub, Deployer, Terraform). I regularly support sales and delivery by establishing the technical foundation, guiding implementation teams, improving development processes, and owning final quality assurance.
