> ‚ÄúProgramming is the only job I can think of where I get to be both an engineer and an artist. There's an incredible, rigorous, technical element to it, which I like because you have to do very precise thinking. On the other hand, it has a wildly creative side where the boundaries of imagination are the only real limitation.‚Äù ‚Äì ***Andy Hertzfeld***

## In detail

I am a certified IT business manager (IHK) and certified TYPO3 integrator, developer and consultant (TCCI, TCCD, TCCC) with many years of project experience and extensive knowledge in the conception, design, implementation, support and project management of user-friendly and intuitive websites based on TYPO3 (PHP, MySQL, Solr, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypoScript).

I also have extensive expertise in the areas of performance optimization (Core Web Vitals), UX/UI design, search engine optimization, integration of analysis, marketing and consent tools (GTM, GA, Matomo, Ads, Hubspot, Usercentrics, Klaro) and the provision of CI/CD processes (GitLab, GitHub, Deployer).

In addition, due to my many years of experience and my continuous training, I am constantly involved in sales processes and project management tasks. I create the technical basis for the implementation of projects and support employees in their implementation. My responsibilities also include optimizing development processes and final quality control.
