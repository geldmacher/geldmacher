> “Programming is the only job I can think of where I get to be both an engineer and an artist. There's an incredible, rigorous, technical element to it, which I like because you have to do very precise thinking. On the other hand, it has a wildly creative side where the boundaries of imagination are the only real limitation.” – ***Andy Hertzfeld***

## In detail

I am a certified IT business manager (IHK) and a certified TYPO3 integrator, developer, and consultant (TCCI, TCCD, TCCC) with many years of project experience and extensive expertise in the conception, design, implementation, support, and project management of user-friendly and intuitive TYPO3-based websites (PHP, MySQL, Solr, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypoScript).

I am also actively working on the practical integration of AI into software engineering processes and web/e-commerce projects. This includes evaluating different AI tools, IDEs, and workflows, supporting colleagues in adopting AI in day-to-day development, and continuously improving internal processes for professional AI usage (e.g., AI-assisted code reviews where appropriate).

In this context, I design and develop an enterprise-ready, multi-purpose AI agent stack (multi-agent, RAG, MCP), built on open-source technologies and engineered for fast adaptation to new domains and rapid POC implementation. I also shape and implement a Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) service that bridges AI directly into the website and e-commerce domain.

I also have extensive expertise in performance optimization (Core Web Vitals), UX/UI design, search engine optimization, integrating analytics/marketing/consent tools (GTM, GA, Matomo, Ads, HubSpot, Usercentrics, Klaro), and providing CI/CD processes (GitLab, GitHub, Deployer).

In addition, based on my many years of experience and continuous training, I am regularly involved in sales processes and project management tasks. I create the technical foundation for project delivery and support teams during implementation. My responsibilities also include optimizing development processes and ensuring final quality control.
